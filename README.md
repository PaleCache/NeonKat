# NeonKat – Cross-Platform Electron Music Player

**NeonKat** is a lightweight, **cross-platform Electron music player** for Linux and Windows. It features **playlist management, a real-time music visualizer, an always-on-top miniplayer, and support for streaming from Jellyfin servers**. NeonKat runs entirely locally - no cloud, no tracking, your music stays on your device. Advanced features include **YT-dlp integration**, **radio streams**, **Neon Mode visualizations synced to the beat**, and **Canvas Mode short video previews**, similar to Spotify’s Canvas feature.  

NeonKat is perfect for users who want a **fast, private, and visually engaging music player** on Linux and Windows systems.
